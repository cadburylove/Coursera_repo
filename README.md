Project Overview
Scenario
You recently got hired as a developer in a micro-finance startup with a mission to empower and provide opportunities for low income individuals. The core team currently uses Subversion (SVN) for managing code. They want to slowly move their code to Git. You are asked to host their sample code to calculate simple interest on GitHub in a new repository as the first step in this journey.

Objectives
Through the following objectives, the project not only achieves its immediate goals, but also lays the foundations for a resilient, collaborative and community-led development process.

Apply Git Best Practices :

Objective : Demonstrate proficiency in Git best practices, including clear commit messages, effective branching strategies, and efficient collaboration.
Rationale : Cultivate a streamlined and organized codebase, fostering a positive development experience for the team.

Work with Git Bash :

Objective : Gain proficiency in using Git Bash for command-line interactions with Git, incorporating it into daily development workflows.
Rationale : Leverage the power and flexibility of Git Bash for efficient and scriptable version control operations.

Create Supporting Documents :

Objective : Provide essential supporting documents, including a Code of Conduct and Contributing Guidelines.
Rationale : Establish a welcoming and inclusive community, ensuring that contributors understand the project's expectations and values.

Open Source Licensing :

Objective : License the repository under the Apache License 2.0.
Rationale : Foster a collaborative and open environment, allowing the broader community to benefit from and contribute to our project while protecting intellectual property.

Facilitate Community Engagement :

Objective : Encourage community engagement and contributions.
Rationale : Create an environment where developers, both within the organization and from the wider community, feel motivated and empowered to contribute to the project.

Document Learning Process :

Objective : Document the learning process and challenges encountered during the transition and open-sourcing of the project.
Rationale : Enable continuous improvement and knowledge sharing within the team, helping future projects benefit from the lessons learned.

Ensure Project Sustainability :

Objective : Implement practices that ensure the project's sustainability over time.
Rationale : Establish a foundation for ongoing development, maintenance, and community involvement in the long term.

Getting Started
As a starting point in our journey, we are adding to our repository a simple function that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.

Input:
   - Principal (P): The initial amount of money invested or borrowed.
   - Time (t): The time the money is invested or borrowed in years.
   - Rate (r): The annual interest rate as a decimal.

Output:
   simple interest = p*t*r
